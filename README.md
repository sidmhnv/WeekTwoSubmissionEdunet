# Week 2 â€“ Garbage Classification with EfficientNetV2B2

This notebook extends the previous submission by:
-> Using the real dataset from Kaggle (6 categories of trash)
-> Counting images per class
-> Fine-tuning the last 20 layers of EfficientNetV2B2
-> Training the model for 5 epochs
-> Visualizing training metrics
-> Making a prediction on a real garbage image
